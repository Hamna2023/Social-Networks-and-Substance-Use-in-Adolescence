# Course Project for Networks & Collective Behaviour course. 
Through our analysis and literature review presented, we concluded that
Social Network analysis techniques can be very helpful in prevention of drug abuse in young
children. If prevention programs are designed using many concepts of network
analysis, the situation can be vastly improved. Drug prevention programs should
be deployed throughout the country especially from middle-school to college
level.
